Tagadelic is a small module, without any databases, or configuration, that generates a page with weighted tags.
All items in a list are not created equally. Thatâ€™s the idea behind weighted lists that, via font size, emphasize popular items and minimize unpopular ones. You can still find items alphabetically but you can also use visual weight to find the most requested items.
